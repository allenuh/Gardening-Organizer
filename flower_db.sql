Its small, yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows from a large rosette of leaves. It grows in a wide variety of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the soil seed bank. It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, and has become invasive in temperate world regions. It is a minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it is not a competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling.','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbascum_thapsus'),(171,'Solidago','https://www.buyrope.co.uk/flower-database/assets/images/content/Solidago.jpg','PLANT IN:  January-December','Solidago, commonly called goldenrods, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.
